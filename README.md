ACP calculator:
Calculate the time that the riders are able to reach the controls. For different distance from the start to the control, the max speed and the min speed of riders are different. The calculator aims to calculate the open time and the close time of the control with the distance. The max speed of the riders is decreasing while the distances increasing. The opening times relate to the max speed that the riders could reach, and the closing time relates to the min speed that the riders could reach. For example, a control at 800 mile would have the opening time with 200/34+200/32+200/30+200/28, and the closing time would be 200/15+200/15+200/15+200/11.428.
Therefore, the opening times are the sum of the control location/max speed at this control location, and the closing times are the sum of the control location /min speed at this control location.
